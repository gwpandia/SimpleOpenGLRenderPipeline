Simple Key Instruction:

New feature:	
	1, 2, 3, 4 :    Switch between four models.
	g          :    Output ZBuffer value to z.txt.
	n	   :    Toggle interpolate Normal, View, Light vectors in Phong Shading.
			I tried to interpolate L, V, N vectors in Phong Shading model.
			But I changed to Gouraud modeling. So this feature is just for fun.
	m	   :	The normal vectors shall be averaged and used in gouraud model, 
			however, if the averaged normal vector is applied the result is strange.
			Press m can see the difference.

Origin feature:
	Spacebar   :    Reset the positions.
	a, s	   :	Model scaling.
	z, x	   :	Light position.
	q, Q	   :	Quit program.
